# Strategy Pattern Demo Project

* Defines a family of algorithms for performing Duck-like actions
* Encapsulates them
* Makes them interchangeable
* Has-A is better than Is-A in most cases!

Strategy lets them vary independently from the algorithms that use it. The program or classes that uses the underlying algorithms program to the interface rather than the concrete implementation.

The duck pond hosts many kinds of ducks and duck-like objects. A normal duck can quack and fly, but a decoy can do neither. But a hunter can only quack.
