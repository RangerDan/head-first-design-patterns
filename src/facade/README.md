- Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
- Provides a higher-level interface that simplifies interacting with the system as a whole.

## Demo Project

A board game cafe offers presets for those renting time in their game rooms. With the push of one button, you can go from brooding cyberpunk dystopia to epic fantasy and back again.  Of course, you can also do your own thing to make a brooding fantasy dystopia, but that's for the expert users...

## Notes

- Does not prevent low-level access.  Merely wraps it.
